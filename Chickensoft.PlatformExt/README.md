# Platform GDExtension

This project was previously shipped as a GDExtension, but because [godot-dotnet] does not have regular releases, this project cannot be easily distributed as a GDExtension and kept up-to-date.

Old documentation provided for reference below:

## üì¶ GDExtension Installation

You can download the zip file from the releases. For a better experience, consider using [GodotEnv] to install and manage it as an addon in your project. In your addons.json file, place the following:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://chickensoft.games/schemas/addons.schema.json",
  "addons": {
    "platform": {
      "source": "zip",
      "subfolder": "platform",
      "url": "https://github.com/chickensoft-games/Platform/releases/download/0.4.0/platform.zip"
    }
  }
}
```

Then, run `godotenv addons install`. You should see a directory named `platform` in your project's `addons` directory.

You can easily invoke the extension from GDScript:

```gdscript
func _ready() -> void:
  var displays = Displays.new()
  var scaleFactor = displays.GetDisplayScaleFactor(get_window())
  print("scale factor: ", scaleFactor)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Building the GDExtension

.NET AOT compilation does not support cross-OS builds yet. You'll only be able to build a few variants on a single OS.

You can use the included `build.sh` script to create the assemblies for your platform.

```sh
./build.sh macos
./build.sh linux
./build.sh windows
```

## ü§ó Contributing

The GDExtension version of this uses the [godot-dotnet] C# GDExtension bindings that are still being actively developed. Since godot-dotnet isn't published yet, we've added a `nuget.config` file to the project which contains the nightly package feed.

Note that you can enumerate all versions of godot-dotnet available for use by running:

```sh
nuget list -Source godot-dotnet -AllVersions -Prerelease
```

There is a Godot sandbox project in `sandbox/Chickensoft.Platform.Sandbox` that you can run to test the library manually on the platforms you have built for. **It has a readme with instructions on how to get it running.**

- [Godot: GDExtension C++ Example](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdextension/gdextension_cpp_example.html)

As of right now, the `warning IL2104: Assembly 'Godot.Bindings' produced trim warnings` shown during build is a known issue. It doesn't prevent anything from working, however.

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Open Questions

Help wanted! We have a few outstanding open questions that we are seeking feedback on:

- [godot-dotnet]: Can we have reloadable GDExtensions written in C#?
- C#: Can we create native iOS libraries (XCFrameworks)?
- C#: Can we create native android libraries? [It seems possible][native-android-libs].
- Linux display scaling: it should be possible to implement display scale factor detection on linux if Godot does not provide an accurate scale factor. This could be done by detecting whether the environment is X11 or Wayland, and then invoking methods in libX11.so or libwayland-client.so, respectively.

If you know the answer to any of these, please open an issue or reach out to us in Discord! We are eager to support more platforms and improve this project.
