# Platform

Platform-specific native extensions for Godot, written in C# and compiled ahead ahead-of-time (AOT).

## ‚úÖ Features

Right now, this project simply provides a way to determine the actual scale factor of the display a Godot window is located on. Godot does not determine the actual scale factor and cannot provide enough information to determine it accurately, so we use various native API's to determine the true scale factor.

- ‚úÖ Determine scale factor on macOS.
- ‚úÖ Determine scale factor on Windows.

## ü§î Why?

The reason this project exists is because ordinary managed C# assemblies loaded by Godot don't have access to the Godot parent process' memory. We need to be able to take the native window pointer provided by Godot and use it with the OS API's ‚Äî something that can only be done from a native library loaded by Godot. Accessing pointers from Godot does not work when hosted as a managed assembly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building

.NET AOT compilation does not support cross-OS builds yet. You'll only be able to build a few variants on a single OS.

You can use the included `build.sh` script to create the assemblies for your platform.

```sh
./build.sh macos
./build.sh linux
./build.sh windows
```

## ü§ó Contributing

This uses the [godot-dotnet] C# GDExtension bindings that are still being actively developed. Since godot-dotnet isn't published yet, we've added a `nuget.config` file to the project which contains the nightly package feed.

Note that you can enumerate all versions of godot-dotnet available for use by running:

```sh
nuget list -Source godot-dotnet -AllVersions -Prerelease
```

It helps if you have read some of the relevant documentation:

- [Microsoft: Building Native Libraries with NativeAOT](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/blob/main/core/nativeaot/NativeLibrary/README.md)
- [godot-dotnet: Godot.Bindings](https://github.com/raulsntos/godot-dotnet/tree/master/src/Godot.Bindings)
- [Godot: GDExtension C++ Example](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdextension/gdextension_cpp_example.html)
- [Source generation for platform invokes (p/invoke)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/native-interop/pinvoke-source-generation)

As of right now, the `warning IL2104: Assembly 'Godot.Bindings' produced trim warnings` shown during build is a known issue. It doesn't prevent anything from working, however.

There is a Godot sandbox project in `sandbox/Chickensoft.Platform.Sandbox` that you can run to test the library manually on the platforms you have built for. **It has a readme with instructions on how to get it running.**

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Open Questions

Help wanted! We have a few outstanding open questions that we are seeking feedback on:

- [godot-dotnet]: Can we have reloadable GDExtensions written in C#?
- C#: Can we create native iOS libraries (XCFrameworks)?
- C#: Can we create native android libraries? [It seems possible][native-android-libs].
- Linux display scaling: it should be possible to implement display scale factor detection on linux if Godot does not provide an accurate scale factor. This could be done by detecting whether the environment is X11 or Wayland, and then invoking methods in libX11.so or libwayland-client.so, respectively.

If you know the answer to any of these, please open an issue or reach out to us in Discord! We are eager to support more platforms and improve this project.
